# NavigationControllerTransitions

Do you want to animate your _UINavigationController_ push and pop transitions?

When you do, do you notice how you can't use the swipe back functionality doesn't work anymore?

All you need to do is reset the _UINavigationController_'s delegate to _nil_ when the animation is complete. That's it.

This project shows you one way to do it (_hint: it's super easy, but does feel like kind of a hack_).
